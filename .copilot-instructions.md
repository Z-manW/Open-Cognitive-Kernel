This repository implements a minimal, deterministic AI governance kernel.

Key constraints:
- The kernel must never rely on AI models to approve actions
- All verification logic must be deterministic and inspectable
- Models are treated as untrusted userland processes
- No autonomous agents, planners, or self-directed loops
- No direct tool execution from model output
- No hidden state or implicit permissions

Design goals:
- Small, readable codebase
- Explicit action schemas and permission checks
- Conservative defaults (deny by default)
- Full audit logging of all decisions

When generating code:
- Prefer simple data structures over abstractions
- Prefer explicit conditionals over heuristics
- Avoid frameworks that obscure control flow
- Keep kernel logic minimal and boring

If a design decision increases intelligence at the cost of control, reject it.
